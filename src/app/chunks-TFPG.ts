  `The death of the emperor Valentinian represents an appropriate moment
to shift our focus from the final pagan generation to their children.`,
  `These children cannot quite be considered the first Christian generation,
but their attitudes about religious policy and service in the courts, impe-
rial administration, and schools differed significantly from those of their
parents.`,
  `The great expansion of offices in the fourth century extended to
provincial elites the administration of an empire that had once been run
primarily by a narrow group of Italian senators and their households.`,
  `1
This was, in many ways, a part of the unique genius of these administra-
tive reforms.`,
  `They both increased the pool of talent on which the empire
could directly draw, and bound these provincial elites to a shared impe-
rial enterprise in a way that had not previously been possible.`,
  `Teachers,
advocates, and other figures who did not hold administrative positions
also benefited.`,
  `Both the demand for their services and the recognition
they received increased as officials took greater interest in their activi-
ties.`,
  `Provincial elites, whose horizons had once been largely confined to
the councils of their home cities, could now aspire to positions that
brought greater wealth, responsibility, and honor.`,
  `The final pagan generation brought up their children expecting that
they would similarly embrace and thrive in this system.`,
  `Many of their
children did, but, by the 360s, it was becoming clear that some children
of the post-Constantinian empire did not react to these opportunities in
the way that their parents hoped.`,
  `Unlike their parents, some elite youth 
of the 350s, 360s, and 370s came to suspect the rewards secular careers
promised, and sought opportunities outside of them.`,
  `In increasing num-
bers, they turned their backs on the lucrative jobs for which they were
training, and embraced either service in the Christian church or, more
controversially, a type of Christian ascetic life.`,
  `This was a process that began before the reign of Valentinian, and its
full effects would not become clear until well after his death, but this
youthful Christian reaction reached its most optimistic and energized
state in the 360s and 370s.`,
  `This chapter considers the origins and devel-
opment of this youth culture from its earliest literary articulations
through to the point at which young elites begin to embrace it as an
alternative to the life their parents imagined for them.`,
  `It begins by look-
ing at possible causes and likely consequences of the first movements of
members of the aristocracy from conventional careers into episcopal
office in the 370s.`,
  `It then turns to the cultural movement through which
young men who had trained to pursue legal, administrative, or teaching
careers chose instead to embrace a form of ascetic Christianity.`,
  `A key
catalyst of this development was Athanasius’s Life of Antony, a text
written to frame the Christian ascetic life in terms that were both
appealing to elites and reassuring to the social world in which they
lived.`,
  `But the reality of embracing an ascetic life or a career in the church
was much more complicated than this literary ideal suggested.`,
  `Young
elites struggled far more than Athanasius’s literary Antony to escape the
social and personal ties that bound them to the traditional Roman social
order.`,
  `Aspiring ascetics and aspiring bishops also faced strong criticism
from parents, teachers, friends, and patrons.`,
  `The chapter concludes by
considering some of the strategies that enabled young Christian drop-
outs to withstand these social and personal pressures.`,
  `elite bishops within and outside of the system
The great expansion of imperial offices and the lucrative compensation
that often came along with them powerfully linked elites to a shared
imperial enterprise in the fourth century.`,
  `2 They willingly traded the lim-
its that public service placed on their conduct for the rewards it prom-
ised.`,
  `The men and women born in the 310s thrived in the imperial sys-
tem and raised their children to take part in it as well.`,
  `Most of the
young born to senatorial and curial families in the 330s, 340s, and 350s
aspired to the same types of offices, honors, and material rewards that
their parents enjoyed.`,
  `These were men like Symmachus, Ausonius’s son
Hesperius, and Libanius’s child Cimon.`,
  `They went to schools and
learned the same skills that their fathers once had.`,
  `These students of the
350s and 360s built networks of peers through the same kinds of drink-
ing parties, kidnappings, and hazing rituals that Libanius and his peers
experienced in the 330s.`,
  `3 And they emerged from the classrooms fired
by the same sorts of ambition that powered Libanius, Ausonius, The-
mistius, and Praetextatus through the 340s and early 350s.`,
  `For young
men like these, the social debts and obligations they owed to the family
members and friends who helped them get established bound them to
the imperial system just as tightly as they had their parents.`,
  `Like their
parents, they were products of a world designed to use their talents,
reward their efforts, and control their reactions.`,
  `Some elite children proved more difficult to control.`,
  `Much of this
had to do with the emergence of new ways for demonstrating elite
achievement that worked differently from the established municipal
and imperial models.`,
  `Elites had customarily taken little interest in serv-
ice within the church.`,
  `Clergy and even bishops had tended to be people
of middling rank who could pursue careers in the church but lacked the
background, means, or the social standing to hold high municipal or
imperial office.`,
  `Beginning in the 370s, however, men who had once
served as teachers, advocates, and even imperial governors entered into
bishoprics, a trend that accelerated as the fifth century approached.`,
  `4
   Ambrose offers perhaps the most familiar example of this new breed
of bishop.`,
  `5 Ambrose came from a wealthy, senatorial, Christian family
that owned extensive property and had built its fortune through service
within the Constantinian imperial administration.`,
  `6 His father eventu-
ally rose to the position of praetorian prefect of Gaul, an office that he
held at the time that Ambrose was born in 339.`,
  `7 He was executed not
long after Ambrose’s birth, and Ambrose grew up in Rome with his
mother, brother, and a sister.`,
  `Ambrose and his brother, Satyrus, prepared
for the same sort of administrative career that their father once enjoyed.`,
  `Satyrus first served as an advocate at the court of the praetorian prefect
and then held a provincial governorship before dying prematurely in
374 or 375.`,
  `8 Ambrose followed a similar path.`,
  `He began as an advo-
cate, took a position as an assessor, and secured the governorship of
Aemilia and Liguria in 370.`,
  `9
   Ambrose’s governorship proved a pivotal moment in his career.`,
  `His
service as governor forced him to become involved in a conflict between
Milanese Christians that threatened to boil over into a violent
confrontation.`,
  `10 His actions so strongly impressed the Nicene Christian
community in the city that, in 374, he agreed to become bishop of
Milan.`,
  `11 Ambrose brought to the position the social and financial
resources of a member of the senatorial elite.`,
  `Ambrose was not Praetex-
tatus, but he was far more impressive than his episcopal peers.`,
  `As the
heir to his father’s large estate, he could personally underwrite a series
of ambitious building and charitable projects that would reshape the
Milanese Nicene church and its position in the city.`,
  `12 His early efforts
included the construction of the church in which his brother was buried,
and the regular distribution of gold coins to those receiving alms.`,
  `13 To
this he added the confidence and connections of a member of the sena-
torial order facing down less accomplished and less socially distin-
guished Arian rivals.`,
  `Ambrose’s status mattered because, as Neil McLynn has shown,
Milan was a town whose leading figures tended to be products of the
Constantinian imperial system.`,
  `14 No well-entrenched councillors or
old-money senators stood above Ambrose in Milan.`,
  `This enabled him
to use his prominence to build a loyal and vocal following among the
people of the city.`,
  `They could be turned out when he needed their voices
heard, but Ambrose had a particular talent for understanding when
such a display might prove necessary and when its mere threat would
suffice.`,
  `15 This made Ambrose a powerful figure whose influence was not
circumscribed by the limits of an imperial office.`,
  `Ambrose himself notes that this was not the career that many would
have envisioned for a former governor and the son of a prefect,16 but the
resources and social obligations of a late fourth-century bishop would
have resembled those available to a member of the imperial elite.`,
  `The
emperor Constantine had given large amounts of money and substan-
tial quantities of goods to the churches to support their sacred and char-
itable activities.`,
  `17 These funds had been cut off by Julian and were even-
tually restored by Jovian at only one-third the Constantinian rate.`,
  `18
Even at this reduced level, these imperial grants remained significant,
and as the fourth century progressed, they were increasingly supple-
mented by private gifts.`,
  `19 As was the case with Ambrose, some bishops
brought private financial resources with them when they joined the
episcopacy.`,
  `20 The Christian tradition of charitable contributions further
augmented the material resources a bishop controlled.`,
  `21 By the 370s,
large urban churches controlled such sizable property portfolios that
the middle-class bishops of the late third and early fourth centuries no
longer had the administrative experience necessary to administer their
finances.`,
  `22 Churches now needed bishops who knew how to manage
large estates, diverse properties, and complicated political relationships.`,
  `This led them increasingly to turn to talented members of the upper
class to manage their affairs.`,
  `In return, the churches offered these men a
way to do recognizably elite activities in a new context of Christian
service.`,
  `The wealth and influence that came along with these positions
even prompted Praetextatus to remark facetiously that he would con-
vert to Christianity if the Christians would make him bishop of Rome.`,
  `23
    Mid-fourth-century bishops had developed powerful voices that
allowed them to serve as effective patrons for their followers.`,
  `Many of
the middle-class bishops of the early fourth century managed to do this,
but as Ambrose’s later career shows, the elite bishops of the late fourth
century could do far more than their predecessors.`,
  `They came to the job
already possessing social relationships with influential figures, familiar-
ity with the imperial appeals process, knowledge of how to organize
and conduct an embassy, and training in how to use the language of the
cultured elite to advocate for friends and associates.`,
  `24 Those who had
served as governors or advocates also had professional training that
directly prepared them for the ecclesiastical courts in which they would
hear civil lawsuits and mediate disputes between congregants.`,
  `25 Bishops
now needed many of the same skills that helped prominent people
maintain their place in the world outside of the church.`,
  `These elite church officers sought a type of success that depended
only somewhat on the imperial system.`,
  `This and their higher social sta-
tus meant that they were less easily cowed by emperors than some of
their socially middling predecessors had been.`,
  `Nevertheless, many of the
traditional metrics for elite achievement still applied to bishops.`,
  `26 Bish-
ops publicly represented their communities in many of the same ways
that leaders of city councils had, they continued to be responsible for
managing estates in the way that large landholders did, and as episcopal
visibility grew in the later fourth century, big-city bishops came to pos-
sess a title that carried with it an understood social prestige.`,
  `27 The pre-
rogatives of office also enabled some bishops to look out for the finan-
cial and social interests of friends and members of their families.`,
  `28
Bishops were responsible for and answerable to congregations.`,
  `They
also needed buildings and administrative staffs to perform their duties.`,
  `If they proved too problematic, emperors could marginalize bishops by
separating them from all of these resources and supporters.`,
  `29 Emperors
still possessed some tools to control the conduct of these men.`,
  `framing elite asceticism in the 360s and 370s
The traditional metrics of elite achievement translated less easily to the
ascetic life.`,
  `Ascetics had been an important and influential part of Chris-
tian communities since the first century, but significant numbers of elites
do not seem to have embraced Christian ascetic practices before the
mid-fourth century.`,
  `30 Early fourth-century Syrian and Egyptian celibate
or continent men and women tended to be people of middling status
who lived in towns, participated in liturgy, and maintained a level of
involvement in the lives of their families.`,
  `31 They were symbolically
important figures whose renunciation of the world gave them authority,
but their voices mattered far less than those of either bishops or the
traditional civic elite.`,
  `Two fourth-century Egyptian developments
changed this.`,
  `First, more radical forms of social renunciation emerged
that pushed some ascetics to practice farther outside the physical and
social spaces of Egyptian cities, towns, and villages.`,
  `At the same time, a
sequence of early fourth-century church conflicts caused various Egyp-
tian ecclesiastical factions to compete for the support of celibates, vir-
gins, and other ascetics.`,
  `As the loyalties of Egyptian town-based ascetics
split between competing Christian groups, bishops attempted to better
regulate their activities out of concern that ascetics loyal to them might
be slandered or induced to follow different ecclesiastical leadership.`,
  `32
Athanasius, the Nicene bishop who did this most aggressively, also
began to celebrate the achievements of ascetics who moved away from
settled areas.`,
  `By the mid-fourth century, a number of different models of
asceticism had developed.`,
  `These included the community-based ascetic
projects pioneered by Pachomius and his followers in the 320s and 330s
and the solitary asceticism practiced by Antony.`,
  `33 Athanasius embraced
these models, worked hard to show his support for the men who had
developed them, and nurtured ties to their followers.`,
  `34
   Athanasius’s support for the Pachomians and communal ascetic
enterprises like theirs shows up repeatedly in mid-fourth-century
sources,35 but his most influential endorsement of a form of asceticism
based outside of cities and towns comes in his landmark Life of Antony.`,
  `This masterful text formed one of the centerpieces of a larger literary
program that Athanasius wrote while he hid from imperial officials
among the monks of northern Egypt in the later 350s.`,
  `36 In the Life,
Athanasius claims a personal relationship with Antony, who had come
to be seen as solitary monasticism’s founder, and uses this to show
Antony’s endorsement of Athanasius’s theological orthodoxy and insti-
tutional authority.`,
  `37 The Life structurally mimics earlier philosophical
biographies in order to argue that the Christian ascetic pursuits of
Antony represent a practical philosophy that surpassed both traditional
Hellenic philosophy and, by implication, the Platonically tinged theol-
ogy of Arius.`,
  `38
    The Life further marks Antony as a figure whose ascetic accomplish-
ments far exceeded those of town-based Christian celibates.`,
  `This is one
of the Life’s more underappreciated purposes, but it is one that ulti-
mately contributes significantly to the text’s larger resonance.`,
  `Athana-
sius’s narration of Antony’s life begins in a world in which celibate
Christians exist only within the structures of village life.`,
  `When Antony
decided to embrace an ascetic life, he entrusted his younger sister to
“known and trusted virgins” who then raised her in virginity.`,
  `39 Antony
himself began his training by finding an old man in a neighboring vil-
lage “who had trained in the solitary life from his youth.`,
  `” Antony then
watched and imitated him.`,
  `40 Once he had learned all he could from this
man, he moved on to learn from others like him.`,
  `He began by visiting
men who lived close to his own village, but Antony ultimately searched
out everyone about whom he heard anything noteworthy.`,
  `He visited
each of them, observed their practices, and then, “gathering the attributes
of each in himself,” he returned to his own place of discipline.`,
  `41
    In Athanasius’s telling, Antony’s achievements went beyond the
assembly of all of the existing best qualities of the ascetics who lived in
Egyptian villages.`,
  `Once he had learned and mastered all of these exist-
ing virtues, Antony pushed beyond the spatial limits of the villages and
the spiritual limits village life set.`,
  `Throughout the first stages of the Life,
Athanasius’s Antony moved progressively farther from settled life.`,
  `He
first moved to the tombs located on the fringe of his village,42 and then
withdrew three times more, each time venturing deeper into the desert,
moving farther from settlements, and pioneering new spatial frontiers in
ascetic practice.`,
  `43 As Antony expanded the boundaries of ascetic life,
ascetic colonists followed him into the tombs and deserts beyond Egyp-
tian cities and towns.`,
  `44
    Athanasius indicates that Antony further surpassed previous ascetics
by completely disentangling himself from the rhythms and demands of
village life.`,
  `Throughout the text, Athanasius systematically breaks down
the ties that linked Antony to the people with whom he shared relation-
ships and the communities in which he lived.`,
  `These were the very rela-
tionships that earlier generations of ascetics would traditionally have
maintained and the same ones that bound the ambitious elite youths of
the post-Constantinian empire to their schools and jobs.`,
  `When Athana-
sius first introduces Antony, he describes him as the child of “well-born
parents” who had “abundant possessions” and controlled over 300
arourae (nearly 200 acres) of fertile farmland.`,
  `45 Athanasius says nothing
about Antony’s hometown (aside from calling it a κώμης or village), but
this amount of land would qualify Antony’s father for membership in
the local curia of all but the largest Egyptian cities.`,
  `46 Possession of this
land brought with it specific financial obligations to the town, obliga-
tions that were not easily shed.`,
  `47 Antony also had obligations to other
people.`,
  `He was responsible for the care of his parents as they aged, for
the raising of his younger sister until she married, and for the mainte-
nance of the household slaves.`,
  `Finally, in a fourth-century context, one
could imagine that many people of Antony’s financial and social posi-
tion would be educated in a way that might equip them to pursue the
lucrative careers in imperial service sought by many of his social peers.`,
  `His property put him right in the middle of the ranks of city councillors
like those who flocked to the schools of Libanius, Ausonius, and The-
mistius in search of new opportunities in imperial service.`,
  `A fourth-century audience would immediately recognize these social
and family obligations as well as the ambitions that often excited men
of Antony’s station.`,
  `This makes Athanasius’s explanation of how Antony
escaped them all the more remarkable.`,
  `Athanasius quickly frees Antony
from the career ambitions of many city councillors by indicating that
Antony could not bear to learn letters and did not seek to build the
relationships with classmates that laid the groundwork for an adminis-
trative career or effective curial service.`,
  `48 Athanasius next frees Antony
of the obligation to take care of his parents by explaining that they both
died by the time he reached age eighteen.`,
  `49 This left Antony responsible
for his household (the house, land, and property, including any slaves),
the curial obligations attached to it, and the care of his young sister.`,
  `He
entrusted his sister to virgins living in the town.`,
  `His family properties
“he gave to the people of the town so that no one would in any way
trouble him or his sister.`,
  `”50 This was consistent both with some third-
century rescripts laying out provisions for the alienation of curial prop-
erty and with fourth century legal provisions for the disposition of
property belonging to clergy.`,
  `51 It was a perfectly legal but not particu-
larly practical solution.`,
  `The first three chapters of the Life of Antony offer an idealized blue-
print for how a member of the local elite could extricate himself from
the personal relationships, financial obligations, and social aspirations
that defined mid-fourth-century elite life.`,
  `The rest of the work, in a sense,
illustrates what one can achieve once these strictures are lifted.`,
  `From the
time that Antony disposed of his last possessions, he “devoted himself to
the discipline rather than the household, attending to himself and
patiently training himself.`,
  `”52 This in turn led to a series of remarkable
spiritual achievements that included successes in demonic combat, heal-
ings of the sick, and visions of the future.`,
  `53 But these spiritual achieve-
ments ultimately led Antony back to the world.`,
  `When he returned, he
managed an estate peopled by ascetic followers, corresponded with
emperors, provided instruction to the entire city of Alexandria, and
refuted the teaching of Greek philosophers.`,
  `54 Ultimately, Athanasius
returns Antony to the world as a figure whose radical renunciation of
conventional social and personal ties lent him a new, powerful type of
authority whose value elites could immediately understand.`,
  `Antony
offered a better, more virtuous path to these ends, but the achievements
of ascetics, like those of bishops, now could be understood in elite terms.`,
  `dropping out
The Life of Antony immediately resonated with elites far beyond the
Egyptian environment in which it was composed.`,
  `It proved wildly popu-
lar with them because it provided a compelling way to articulate in
attractive, elite terms a movement that was already beginning to take root
across the empire.`,
  `55 The popularity of the Life is broadly evident across a
host of later fourth-century milieus.`,
  `Latin translations appeared quickly,
with the first coming perhaps in the early 360s and the second, by Eva-
grius, as early as 365 or 370.`,
  `56 In 375, Jerome wrote the Life of Paul, a
clumsy, fictional imitation of the Life that mentions both the Greek orig-
inal text and the Latin translation.`,
  `57 In 392, Jerome’s De viris inlustribus
(On Illustrious Men) mentioned the composition of the Life of Antony as
one of the highlights of Athanasius’s literary career and placed its transla-
tion into Latin among Evagrius’s most memorable achievements.`,
  `58 In
380, Gregory Nazianzen began a homily on Athanasius with the wish
that he might someday be able to commemorate the recently departed
bishop in a work like the one Athanasius had written to celebrate
Antony.`,
  `59 It is notable, of course, that all of these early translators and
literary imitators belong to the generation that came of age in the 350s
and 360s; they were the Christian children of the final pagan generation.`,
  `The Life did more than simply capture the literary imagination of
these young men.`,
  `In at least one case, it also inspired actions.`,
  `In his
Confessions, Augustine tells about two courtiers of the emperor Valen-
tinian who picked up the Life of Antony while killing time outside the
city of Trier.`,
  `Before the first of them had even finished reading it, Augus-
tine recounts, “he conceived of the idea of taking up the same kind of
life for himself and abandoning the world.`,
  `”60 The two men then made a
commitment to each other to walk away from their careers and support
one another in an ascetic life.`,
  `A host of other authors writing in the 370s and 380s mention similar
ascetic compacts between young elites.`,
  `The young men who made these
agreements to leave the world and embrace an ascetic life saw them as
binding contracts that, once made, could not be broken.`,
  `61 In an early let-
ter written to Theodore, one of the men with whom he made such an
agreement, John Chrysostom, describes the reason for their choice.`,
  `62
“The things of this world,” he writes, “are in their nature no better than
dreams,”63 while those who embrace God will spend eternity in peace,
happiness, and joy.`,
  `64 Theodore, John continues, recognized all of this.`,
  `He
disregarded fine food, fancy clothes, and public processions with his
attendants, never mentioned his prominent family, and never thought of
wealth.`,
  `65 Instead, all he wished to do was run to the brothers he recog-
nized as pursuing something far more noble than high birth.`,
  `When Theo-
dore moved away from the shadowy concerns of this world, he embraced
a life dedicated to the glory of God.`,
  `66
    Even with the steadfast (and rather pushy) support of like-minded
friends, disentangling oneself from the concerns of this world proved
extremely difficult for young elites.`,
  `67 Chrysostom knew this from his
own experience.`,
  `Not long after he had completed his studies and began
work as a lawyer, a fellow student named Basil decided to take up the
life of the monks.`,
  `68 Chrysostom and Basil had studied with the same
teachers and had always shown the same enthusiasm for learning.`,
  `69 The
families of both men were equally wealthy and enjoyed the same social
rank.`,
  `70 The paths of the two men diverged when they left school.`,
  `Chrys-
ostom began practicing law, angling for a bureaucratic appointment,
and enjoying the pleasures of the city, while Basil embraced an ascetic
life.`,
  `As their friendship began to fray, Basil proposed that Chrysostom
follow his lead in abandoning the concerns of the world.`,
  `The two men
would then move in together so that each could support the other.`,
  `71
    The partnership between Chrysostom and Basil ultimately fell apart
when Basil was ordained.`,
  `In fact, we know about Chrysostom’s partner-
ship with Basil primarily because Chrysostom felt compelled to write a
defense of his own flight from church office in the first sections of his
work De sacerdote (On the Priesthood).`,
  `72 But this was not always the
reaction of young dropouts like Chrysostom when faced with the pros-
pect of ordination.`,
  `Chrysostom’s earlier contemporaries Gregory
Nazianzen and Basil of Caesarea looked to balance their commitment
to an ascetic lifestyle with the demands of ordained ministry.`,
  `73 These
two Cappadocians studied together in Athens and returned to their
home region in the mid-350s hoping to balance their interest in asceti-
cism with their obligations as members of the local elite.`,
  `Basil was the
son of a teacher in Caesarea, and he had been encouraged by an embassy
of local magistrates to teach in his home city when he finished his edu-
cation.`,
  `74 Gregory too had prepared for a teaching career that he was
expected to begin when he returned to his home region of Nazianzus.`,
  `75
Both men had positioned themselves to assume these positions, and set
off for Athens to get final training before returning home to begin their
teaching careers.`,
  `When Gregory and Basil got to Athens, however, each had a difficult
time adjusting to the city.`,
  `Basil was hazed aggressively, though Gregory
stepped in at one point to rescue him from a particularly heated encoun-
ter with some Armenians.`,
  `76 Even more challenging was the religious
environment in the city.`,
  `Gregory described it as so full of idols of the
gods that it was hard not to be carried along by the popular embrace of
traditional religion.`,
  `77 He and Basil worked together to counteract this.`,
  `They lived together, went to church together, and became dear friends
whose feelings for one another grew “ever warmer and stronger.`,
  `”78 They
supported one another in this difficult religious environment, and before
they left Athens, the two friends made a pact to abandon their teaching
careers and live an ascetic life together.`,
  `Basil returned from Greece, taught briefly in Caesarea, and traveled
in the East for a time.`,
  `Around 357 or 358, he decided to retreat to a
family property in Pontus in order to live the life that he and Gregory
had discussed.`,
  `79 He settled by himself across a river from the estate
where the rest of the family spent time.`,
  `He then wrote to Gregory,
reminded him of their promise to live together as ascetics, and invited
him to come to Pontus to join him.`,
  `80 Gregory wrote back in late 357 or
early 358 admitting that he had lied when he promised to live in an
ascetic partnership with Basil.`,
  `81 This was not an intentional lie, Gregory
explains, because “the law that commands us to care for our parents
trumped the law of our companionship and intimacy,” and Gregory
needed to put the needs of his family first.`,
  `82 After another series of
letters, however, Basil convinced Gregory to come to Pontus in 359.`,
  `Gregory stayed for a short time, and then decided to return to his family
and his teaching.`,
  `He did not abandon asceticism but instead tried to
fashion a type of ascetic practice that did not take him from his familial
and social obligations.`,
  `83
    Gregory’s desire to remain attached in some fashion to the larger elite
social world placed him in a middle ground between the radical renun-
ciations of Antony and the episcopal track of Ambrose.`,
  `This was not a
position that he would be allowed to occupy for long.`,
  `If he would not
fully renounce the world, the church had uses for him.`,
  `In 361, Gregory
seems to have been ordained into the priesthood.`,
  `84 He made a show of
refusing the office and fled to Basil’s retreat in Pontus, but his friend
encouraged him to stop fighting the appointment.`,
  `85 Gregory returned
home in early 362, and, later that year, Basil too was ordained.`,
  `86 The
two young men then exchanged a series of letters in which they worked
through how their new positions as priests could be reconciled with the
ascetic pursuits that they wished to continue.`,
  `This was, Gregory wrote,
“not something that we aimed for,” but since the ordination had hap-
pened with the blessing of the Holy Spirit, “we must put up with it.`,
  `”87
    In a later letter, Gregory indicates that the ascetic brotherhood that
bound him to Basil continued to join the two men now that they served
the church.`,
  `In 365, he responded to a letter sent by the bishop Eusebius
of Caesarea that summoned him to a synod.`,
  `Gregory thanked the bishop
for the invitation but claimed that he could not “tolerate the insult that
came, and which still comes, from your reverence against the most honor-
able brother Basil, whom from the beginning I have adopted and still
have now as a partner in life, word, and the most exalted philosophy—
and I find nothing at fault in my own judgment of him.`,
  `”88 This initiated a
series of exchanges in which Eusebius accused Gregory of being haughty
and mean-spirited, while Gregory held firm that Basil must also be sum-
moned to the synod.`,
  `89 When an invitation to Basil appeared to be forth-
coming, Gregory then wrote to his friend and asked whether he thought
“it good for me to be present, living and travelling together with you.`,
  `”90
If so, Gregory continued, “then let’s not run away from this” but take a
stand so that “no one may seem more courageous than us and so that our
many drops of sweat and labors do not suddenly come to nothing.`,
  `”91
    Gregory and Basil’s relationship evolved greatly in the period between
355 and 365, but the mutual support they offered one another remained
an important element of it throughout this decade.`,
  `What began as a
scholastic friendship developed into a long-distance ascetic brother-
hood before transforming again into an episcopal alliance.`,
  `The appar-
ent ease of this evolution obscures the important fact that both Basil
and Gregory sought support from one another throughout this process.`,
  `The challenges they faced in Athens are in some ways readily apparent
to us, but both their embrace of asceticism and their path into the clergy
presented their own difficulties that required emotional and tangible
support.`,
  `parents just don’t understand
The families of both Basil and Gregory supported their decisions to
embrace Christian service, but many of their peers were not so fortunate.`,
  `Older elites did not always take kindly to the decisions of their children
to become bishops or ascetics.`,
  `Parents sometimes charged sons who
entered the episcopacy with a betrayal of their obligations to their fami-
lies.`,
  `In 373, Amphilochius, a cousin of Gregory, a former student of Liba-
nius, and the son of one of Libanius’s classmates,92 decided to abandon a
career as an advocate and become bishop of Iconium.`,
  `93 His father, who
had served as an advocate and teacher of rhetoric, was appalled and
blamed Gregory for stealing his son and leading him astray.`,
  `94 He com-
plains that he feels that his son “will not be present with [him].`,
  `he will
not tend to [his] old age.`,
  `he will not help out in day-to-day affairs as
he usually does.`,
  `”95 Gregory explains to his uncle that Amphilochius had
made this decision on his own, and chastises his uncle for “bringing
charges against me, as I am learning, and thinking that your son and my
brother is being neglected or betrayed by me.`,
  `”96 This is wrong, Gregory
continues, because “I placed the hopes of life in him and assumed that he
was the only support, the only good advisor, the only sharer of piety.`,
  `”97
Gregory’s letter shows the degree to which these young men supported
each other when they made a choice that their elders opposed.`,
  `Gregory’s own jump from a career as a teacher to one within the
church helped him to understand and support Amphilochius’s decision.`,
  `He knew that, as a bishop, Amphilochius could continue acting as a
friend and leader of his community while also giving service to the
church.`,
  `Libanius, Amphilochius’s former teacher, had more trouble mak-
ing sense of his student’s embrace of episcopal office.`,
  `Upon hearing of
Amphilochius’s decision, Libanius sent Amphilochius a letter that showed
a subtle dismay about the choice.`,
  `He explained that Amphilochius had
once been an example of a student whose career refuted the criticism that
Libanius had not trained any really successful students.`,
  `98 His work as an
advocate had been admirable, and it served as an effective rejoinder to

Libanius’s rivals, but Amphilochius no longer offered Libanius this pos-
sibility.`,
  `As bishop, Libanius continued, Amphilochius could at least find
a way to use his eloquence to excite an audience and get applause—a
situation that at least salvaged some of his rhetorical talents.`,
  `99 By fram-
ing Amphilochius’s new position in conventionally elite terms, this odd
comment shows Libanius trying his best to explain a situation whose
import he did not entirely understand.`,
  `Amphilochius’s responsibility for his congregation, his connections
to other influential men, and his continued occasions for practicing
rhetoric offered a type of authority that his father and teacher could
recognize.`,
  `Young ascetics had less tangible influence and, therefore,
often faced more resistance from friends, family members, and depend-
ents when they left a conventional career path.`,
  `When John Chrysostom
told his mother about his decision to abandon a legal career in order to
live an ascetic life alongside his classmate Basil, her “continual lamenta-
tions” hindered him.`,
  `Chrysostom’s father had died when he was young,
and his mother reminded him of all that she had done to raise him.`,
  `100
She spoke of her efforts to manage the domestic slaves, to beat back the
lawsuits of family members, and to defend her family against the threats
of tax collectors.`,
  `101 She had not remarried so that Chrysostom might
inherit his father’s estate intact, and she reminded him that she used her
own dowry and family resources in order to “spare no expense that was
necessary to give him an honorable position.`,
  `”102 She had clearly hoped
that Chrysostom would succeed in the same way that many others of
his age did.`,
  `If he chose to turn away from the wealth and career success
for which she had set him up, his mother asked one thing.`,
  `In return for
all that she had done, she wanted Chrysostom to “wait for her death”
before he left home.`,
  `103
    Other figures faced even more difficult obstacles.`,
  `People with particu-
larly large estates or complicated domestic arrangements could find it
extremely difficult to relinquish their property or step away from obliga-
tions to members of their household.`,
  `104 Later ascetic leaders even coun-
seled men who wanted to join a monastery not to do so until dependent
children, parents, or elderly slaves no longer needed their care.`,
  `105 Two of
Chrysostom’s contemporaries show what could happen to those who
failed to disentangle themselves completely from the obligations and
expectations of fourth-century society.`,
  `His friend Theodore momentar-
ily stepped away from the ascetic life when he fell in love with a woman
named Hermione.`,
  `106 Even more significant was the case of an unnamed
Phoenician man.`,
  `His father, Urbanus, had worked as an assessor to the

comes Orientis Modestus from 358 until 362 and had built up a sub-
stantial family fortune.`,
  `107 While Urbanus lived, his son “bid complete
farewell to his studies in the schools” and retreated to the mountains to
pursue “Christian philosophy.`,
  `” Urbanus’s premature death forced the
young man to return to the elite world his father had mastered.`,
  `Someone
needed to help administer the “great deal of money and many slaves and
lands” his father had left.`,
  `As the only surviving member of the family,
this young man agreed to do so.`,
  `He then “used to go all around the city,
riding on horseback, accompanied by a large retinue” and became
“inflamed by much luxury.`,
  `”108
   There were many more men who, like Theodore and this Phoenician
youth, abandoned their postadolescent flirtations with an ascetic life in
the 370s when their parents left them the family property.`,
  `This may, in
fact, have even been true of the vast majority of the dropouts of the
370s.`,
  `But their friends and peers often did not let them go easily.`,
  `The
Phoenician youth found himself continually confronted by his former
ascetic brothers.`,
  `He ignored them at first, but they persisted until “he
would instantly dismount.`,
  `and in time he displayed even greater rev-
erence and respect towards them.`,
  `” Ultimately, Chrysostom explains,
“they handed him over again to his former state of seclusion and devout
contemplation.`,
  `”109
   Chrysostom did the same thing to Theodore.`,
  `When Theodore fell in
love with Hermione, Chrysostom wrote to him that worldly affairs like
wives, children, and domestic slaves only distracted the soul.`,
  `He then
commented that he found it strange of Theodore to be so unwilling to
try to return to his discipline when others “are continually praying that
they might have their member restored to them.`,
  `”110 Chrysostom himself
felt this same type of pressure when Basil repeatedly pressed him to
abandon his mother and take up an ascetic life.`,
  `111
   Fourth-century Christian ascetics of all social stations recognized the
power of these intensely personal appeals.`,
  `This was, of course, the fun-
damental organizing principle of the Pachomian Koinonia and the sub-
sequent cenobitic monastic foundations that evolved out of its pioneer-
ing model.`,
  `112 Some elites, like Pachomius’s Egyptian protégé Theodore,
did join the larger cenobitic communities that were springing up
throughout the empire.`,
  `But young elites like Chrysostom, Theodore, and
the courtiers at Trier tended to avoid large institutional enterprises like
the Koinonia.`,
  `They instead formed small, collaborative enterprises that
used social relationships like those members of the elite formed at school
to provide positive reinforcement for certain behaviors that most of

society did not endorse.`,
  `Instead of creating a schoolboy camaraderie
that reinforced one’s commitment to the aspirations of traditional aris-
tocratic life, these smaller ascetic groups existed to give young men the
strength to pursue goals that diametrically opposed those endorsed by
their parents, teachers, and many of their peers.`,
  `They were, in Seth
Schwartz’s conception of a counterculture, embracing solidarity over
reciprocity.`,
  `113 As modern sociologists have shown, creating this type of
socially isolating community is one of the most effective ways to get
people to adopt and maintain behaviors well outside of established
social norms.`,
  `114 In the schools, these structures encouraged antisocial
behaviors like rioting and excessive drinking that nonstudents shunned.`,
  `In elite ascetic circles, they promoted a withdrawal from the social and
material objectives to which most of their peers aspired.`,
  `The achievements these ascetic circles celebrated differed from those
that marked a successful bishop and diverged dramatically from those
that most members of the fourth-century Roman elite valued.`,
  `The great
success of the tetrarchic and Constantinian expansion of government
bureaucracy derived from the emperors’ unprecedented ability to link
wealth, honor, and social prominence to participation in imperial polit-
ical life.`,
  `This created a social momentum that encouraged elites to aspire
to certain types of achievement defined by the Roman imperial system.`,
  `The ascetic circles created by Chrysostom’s friends and the courtiers in
Trier looked like nodes in an elite social network, but they exerted a
different sort of social pressure.`,
  `Instead of encouraging the pursuit of
conventional success, they pushed young elites to drop out of the impe-
rial system.`,
  `These groups of friends explicitly framed their embrace of
asceticism as a rejection of the system in which they had been trained to
excel.`,
  `115 They spoke repeatedly about the folly of the rewards that sys-
tem promised.`,
  `They supported one another when unsympathetic friends
and family members pushed them to return to it.`,
  `And some of these men
began to write extensively so that they could better articulate the alter-
native value structure that guided them.`,
  `116 As these ideas spread among
young elites, they diluted the power of the social incentives that the
empire used to guide elite conduct.`,
  `•   •   •

By the 380s, the growing interest in ascetic circles and episcopal service
among young Christians created two subgroups of curial and senatorial
figures over whom imperial officials had limited influence.`,
  `117 The young
men who entered church offices remained somewhat engaged with the
wider world.`,
  `They were uninterested in offices and honors defined by
the imperial system, but they remained plugged into elite social and
cultural networks.`,
  `They also depended on imperial resources and
approval in order to effectively do their jobs.`,
  `Unlike the men who
entered episcopal service, the young ascetic dropouts often formed insu-
lar groups that monitored each other’s behavior, criticized any aberrant
tendencies, and rejected any worldly things that conflicted with their
spiritual objectives.`,
  `These were the first elites of the fourth century who
immunized themselves against the rewards that imperial officials could
offer and the punishments they could inflict.`,
  `118
   The empire seems initially not to have anticipated the challenges that
these new types of bishops and ascetics presented.`,
  `Since the later third
century, emperors had worked to find ways to make more efficient use
of the large numbers of talented members of the provincial elite.`,
  `They
did this by creating an expanded administrative apparatus that involved
these men and sometimes richly rewarded their cooperation.`,
  `Their
efforts worked so well that some young men came to see the system
their parents had so readily embraced as a “soul-destroying” thing to be
resisted.`,
  `119 This was, in some ways, a natural reaction to a system that
had done everything it was intended to do.`,
  `But, as is often the case with
such movements, the ideas that once motivated the radical renuncia-
tions of 360s, 370s, and 380s became a part of the mainstream.`,
  `As more
people came to accept the authority that these young Christian bishops
and ascetics claimed, the Roman social and administrative system
needed to find ways to contain their influence and direct their energies.`,
  `As the 380s will show, the empire was not always successful.`
